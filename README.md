# FUA-RESEARCH

## Introduction
This project investigates the spatial drivers and propagation mechanisms of urban air pollutant emissions across 619 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) in Europe. We focus on four major pollutants—CO₂, NOx, SO₂, and PM₂.₅—and examine their relationships with 14 socioeconomic and spatial variables. The study integrates machine learning models with SHAP-based interpretability, geographically weighted regression (GWR) to capture spatial heterogeneity, and graph attention networks (GAT) to model inter-FUA influence. This multi-method approach enables a comprehensive understanding of both local emission patterns and spatial interaction effects across FUAs.
